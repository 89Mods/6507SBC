# Programs

Here are various programs to test the computerâ€™s hardware, and stress the CPU and Memory (mandelbrot renderer). Due to the memory map of the system, the ROM binaries must be padded with 1024 bytes of 0s at the beginning. The PadROM script written in Java takes care of this.

Every program is contained in its own directory, which also contains a bash script to automatically run all the commands to build the program. cc65 is required to assemble the programs.
